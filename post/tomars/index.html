        <p>I&rsquo;ve had an idea for decades now bouncing around in my head. I loved everything
put out on MS Paint Adventures, from Bard&rsquo;s tale to Homestuck. I liked the idea
of readers having an influence on what happens next in the story; that the author
would have to adjust and adapt the story based on the user input. Kinda like a
real-time democratic choose your own adventure book. I want to make something like
that, but inside a video game. I&rsquo;ve been throwing ideas at the wall, trying to
see what would stick to make this dream a reality. Well, I think the idea has
finally hatched.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make a video game in episodes. It&rsquo;s called MarsBound and it&rsquo;s about
a crew&rsquo;s adventure from Earth to Mars. But with a twist! The storyline will be
branched, but the players themselves get to make the choices! What job does each
crewmate have? What are the crewmates&rsquo; names? What items does the crew buy at this
store? How many? What stat boost does the character take at level up? Do we take
a turn into the spooky space-forest or try to ford the asteroid belt directly?
These decisions and more will be made by the players. How, you ask? Well, the game
will be released at a specific time (I haven&rsquo;t figured out the exact details yet)
on Twitch. The controls will be a poll that says &ldquo;Up&rdquo;, &ldquo;Down&rdquo;, &ldquo;Left&rdquo;, &ldquo;Right&rdquo;,
&ldquo;A&rdquo;, or &ldquo;B&rdquo;. Every couple minutes or after it reaches enough votes (details
will be forthcoming as I playtest and see myself) the  input will be sent to the
game. Kinda like Twitch Plays Pokemon, but with my own new game. Whatever decisions
Twitch makes will be recorded and saved as the <strong>actual</strong> canon of my game.</p>
<p>To speed up development, such as commisioning art and resources, as well as
allowing my self more development time (and give fans something to buy),
I&rsquo;m going to start a Patreon for this. The Patreon will consist of tiers that
add neat stuff to the game, such as a downloadable execuatble of the game (non-canon), and even a game-guide provided before the chapter release, so you can
coordinate a trip to mars more effeciently!</p>
<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s my idea. Thanks for listening.</p>
