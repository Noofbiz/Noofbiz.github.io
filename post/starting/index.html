        <p>Hello world!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back! And going to try to start blogging about whatever I feel like, when I feel like it. (At least once a day, about the day)
So, let&rsquo;s start with today!</p>
<p>P.S. I should take pictures to put on here maybe?</p>
<h1 id="walmart-trip-1">Walmart trip 1<a href="#walmart-trip-1" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>So, after dropping Grayson off at school, I went to the store to pick up a couple things. Food and such.
Walmart has gotten way more crowded. I think they pushed the asiles closer together to fit more in the store.
This makes the asiles much more cramped. You can&rsquo;t walk past another cart anymore. It&rsquo;s pretty annoying.</p>
<h1 id="marsbound">Marsbound<a href="#marsbound" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I did very little work on this today. Just added a bit to the script. I plan on using my free time for this
until I make it to the takeoff scene. Then I&rsquo;ll finish the skeleboy studios site game. I can use the code
I make for that on Marsbound, so it&rsquo;s really going to be working on Marsbound still!</p>
<h1 id="school-work">School work<a href="#school-work" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I do homeschool with Milo now, because he couldn&rsquo;t get the support he needed at school. We work on math,
reading, science, and history. It&rsquo;s pretty fun. He&rsquo;s getting pretty good at single digit addition! The
science experiment today was about how plants use their stems to transport moisture. We put celery in
water with food coloring and watched the celery change color. It should get even more colored overnight,
so we&rsquo;ll see what happens in the morning.</p>
<h1 id="walmart-trip-2">Walmart trip 2<a href="#walmart-trip-2" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>We got an automatic watering pump for our hydroponic setup today. I went back to walmart to search for a
container to hold the water. I ended up getting a cereal container to keep the water in. It works good.</p>
<h1 id="crunchwrap-supremes">Crunchwrap Supremes!<a href="#crunchwrap-supremes" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I got the new crunchwrap supreme kit while I was at Walmart. We made that for dinner. It turned out pretty
awesome.</p>
<h1 id="the-grim-reaper-shop-and-scavenger-hunt">The Grim Reaper Shop and Scavenger Hunt<a href="#the-grim-reaper-shop-and-scavenger-hunt" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Milo setup a scavenger hunt for us! In this one, when I stepped outside the door, there was a note. It read
&ldquo;But Nobody Came&rdquo;, an Undertale reference. I looked on the TV stand, where he put Orange and Pink (Among-Us
plushies of Milo&rsquo;s) last time we played. They were gone! In their place, another note.</p>
<p>It read &ldquo;But Nobody Came&rdquo; again! So I turned around. Behind me was Orange with a KNIFE in his back! Pink
was beside him, and there was a third note! It read &ldquo;Orange! Don&rsquo;t give up on me! Please! Wake Up!
ORANGE! OOOOORANGE!?!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the couch was a fourth note. It was Reddy, Milo&rsquo;s plushy dinosaur. The note read &ldquo;?&rdquo;. But then Milo rewound time
for me. He showed me that Reddy was PRETENDING to not know what was going on. Reddy was actually the IMPOSTER
this time! He stabbed Orange! Oh no!</p>
<p>After that, Milo setup the Grim Reaper shop, where he dressed up in his Soul Taker costume and pretended to sell
me stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about it for today! I&rsquo;ll update tomorrow! I hope!</p>
